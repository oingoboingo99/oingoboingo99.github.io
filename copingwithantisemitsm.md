# Resources for Coping with Antisemitism

Note: To those considering converting, I encourage you to read about antisemitism and especially how you cope about it below. It will potentially be vary daunting and frightening if you decide to progress with your conversion, and you eventually become the target of antisemitism. Learning about how to cope and deal with these situation in advance could potentially alleviate some anxiety, even if it is just a small amount.

## Understanding Antisemitism

Sometimes, understanding the experiences of other Jews and how absurd antisemitsm really is can be a useful coping mechanism - as it reminds you others are going through the same thing, and that those perpetuatuing these beliefs are just hateful and irrational. These texts below are meant to provide that sense of mutual understanding with other Jews, and/or explain antisemitism from a Jewish perspective.
If you are considering converting, I encourage that you learn about the Holocaust, Farhud, Dhimmi system, mass expulsion of Jews from Europe/MENA/SWANA/etc. as it is our collective trauma as a people, and it is our responsibility to remember these tragedies so that we may prevent them again the the future.
