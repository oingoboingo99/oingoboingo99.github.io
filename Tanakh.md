## Obtaining a Free Tanakh

This website and its resources are intended for Jews or those who are in the process of converting to Judaism. Unfortunately, we cannot provide resources to Massianic Christians. We kindly request you do not request free Judaica from any resources listed on this site if you are not Jewish or in the progress of becoming Jewish.

### Free Hardcopy Hardcover Tanakh

The website [Jewish testimonies](https://www.jewishtestimonies.com/en/) distributes free Tanakh to anyone who identifies as Jewish. However, please be aware that this foundation is intended for Messianic Christians.
Our advice is that when ordering, only order the Hebrew-English Tanakh and click "No" when they ask if you would also like a New Testament.

When you order they will send you an email and you will just need to confirm your mailing address and name, so they can post you the Tanakh.

[They can provide Tanakh in English, Romanian, Russian, Hungarian, German, Portuguese, Yiddish, Spanish and French.](https://www.sdhs.co.uk/index.php/publications/request-printed-copy/)

One of the creators of this website ordered the Tanakh from this website and it is completely fine and unaltered from a normal Tanakh. The Tanakh is actually provided by the "The Society for Distributing Hebrew Scriptures" which is a trustworthy source of texts and prints. To quote: "After ordering they did not send me any emails trying to convert me to Christianity, and they were perfectly happy to send me a Tanakh despite me noting I have no interest in the New Testament. I think this is a good option if you cannot afford to purchase a Tanakh".
