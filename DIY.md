# How to Make Your Own Judaica

## What Judaica do I need?

If you are reconnecting with your faith or have found yourself drawn to the Judaism as a convert, you may want certain pieces of Judaica. Some useful items include:

- A kippah/head covering. Many women also elect to wear a Tichel, but it is only "required" (there is some debate on this) for married women.
- Tzitzit/Tallit (only required to be worn by men, but others can voluntarily wear them as well).
- Menorah
- Candles (for Menorah, Shabbat, etc.)
- Kiddush Cup
- Tefillin (only required for men, but others can voluntarily wear them as well).
- Passover Seder Plate.
- Yad (Torah Pointer)
- Afikomen Bags, etc.

If you are like me, and have quite a small budget, it is unlikely that you will be able to afford nice, high quality Judaica, and therefore you might want to make your own. While some items are difficult to DIY, others, such as kippah, tallit, etc. can easily be made at home with simple tools.

## DIY Tallit

Please note - when selecting fabric for Tallit, DO NOT buy any fabric that is mixed linen and wool. If you have a low budget, thick bed-sheets are always a good option. Thrift stores may also have fabric or old sheets you can repurpose (just carefully wash them on a high temp first).

## DIY Menorah

Note: If you can buy cheap tea lights, personally, in the past I have just lined up tealights or random candles in a row and used that as a Menorah. I reccommend looking at Ikea, as they have some really nice but very cheap tea lights that would look quite fancy in my opinion.
