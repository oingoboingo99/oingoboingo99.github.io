## Specifically Advice for CryptoJews Wanting To Reconnect With Their Heritage

Are you halachically Jewish but grew up secular and disconnected from your heritage? Did your family have to hide the fact that they were Jewish, leading you to grow up unaware of your heritage? This is the situation many Jews face. In this situation, I would heavily suggest talking to a Rabbi first about your Jewish status, to determine if you need to complete a conversion or what your course of action should be. 

Otherwise, I would reccomend reading the suggested articles on the page for those wishing to convert to Judaism (while someone might technically be Jewish, if one has a complete lack of knowledge about Judaism, it is much the same process of learning).
