# Books For Those Considering Judaism

Shalom, I am happy to hear you feel connected to Judaism! We are a non-proselytizing religion (meaning we do not seek to convert people) and therefore converting to Judaism is a little bit different. As well, as Judaism as a enthocultural practice, converting to Judaism is a bit more like converting into a religion AND a culture, meaning I would reccomend you hevaily research the Jewish lifestyle and talk with a Rabbi (or several) to help decide if Judaism is for you or not.

### A Quick Summary on Conversions
Converting to Judaism is oftentimes a long process - on the short end for reform conversions, they will take at the least 12-18 months. For an orthodox conversion, it will take closer to several years (I have heard people taking as long as 10+). Please keep in mind, even if you are eager for the process to be quicker, that as Judaism is an enthocultural practice it will take a long time to learn our language/s and experience all of the holidays and practices. The purposes of the longer timeline are to ensure you have experienced every holiday at least once under the guidance of your community and a Rabbi - meaning it is essential. 
Obviously, for those truly interested, the time spent will not be a deterrent, but I understand it can still seem a bit intimidating or offputting - if that is the case, I strongly suggest speaking to a Rabbi and discussing your feelings about the process to sort out if it is right for you.

## Essential Books

These books discuss the Jewish lifestyle and our practices. Before converting, I urge you to at least read one. Most Rabbis will ask you to read up on Judaism, and oftentimes will reccomend one or several of these books (if you are an English speaker).

- [The Fundamentals of Judaism (A short 15 Page PDF. Not very detailed, but a good primer before the other books).](http://www.totetu.org/assets/media/paper/j015_138.pdf)
- Living a Jewish Life (PDF Available via Search on Google) - Great more detailed first look into Jewish practices.
- Essential Judaism: A Complete Guide to Beliefs, Customs and Rituals by George Robinson
- Jewish Literacy: The Most Important Things to Know about the Jewish Religion, Its People and Its History by Joseph Telushkin
- A History of Judaism by Martin Goodman

## Important Books About Antisemitism

If you choose to convert into Judaism, you are choosing to convert into our community - therefore it is important to know about the history of your new community. It is also important to read about the history of antisemitism and its forms, so that you can avoid perpetuating antisemitism yourself and are able to recognise more subtle and non-violent forms of it in society.

- Trials of the Diaspora: A History of Anti-Semitism in England (For those converting in the UK).
- Hate: The Rising Tide of Anti-Semitism in France (and What It Means for Us) - For those converting in France.
- The War Against the Jews: 1933-1945 (About the Holocaust)

## Books About Jewish "Sects"

Before converting - I do urge you to read up on the different movements in Judaism. Many people, especially LGBT+ prospective converts, will often will forced to select Reform or Reconstructionist conversion, however, please know that every movement will have people who are accepting and those who are not. To those who are LGBT+, I urge you to first read about the differing beliefs of each movement. If you find yourself drawn to any movement, you can then search "LGBT+ friendly/Gay friendly Orthodox/Reform/etc. Rabbi in my city" to help you start your journey.
